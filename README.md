This is a basic ecommerce site using django to implement a shopfront, cart functionality, checkout functionality, with payments being handled by stripe. 

The main branch uses postgres for the database, the pipenv branch uses the default sqlite database, to make deployment a little easier.

Hosted on an AWS ec2 instance.
